# Discovery Market – Status Log

## P0 Setup
- **Built**: Repository layout, config.yaml, data/*.csv from Tables 1-3.
- **Check**: `test_table1_*`, `test_table2_*`, `test_table3_*`, `test_config_loads` — all 7 PASSED.
  CSVs match the specification tables exactly.
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

## P1 Engine (market.py)
- **Built**: Pure-logic market engine with pluggable cost models (Track A / Track C),
  Beta-distribution beliefs, credit conservation checks, event and ledger generation.
- **Checks (33 tests)**:
  - Credit conservation over 5 seeds (simple + full Track A + Track C): 15 PASSED
  - Bid-rule boundary (no bid at/below, bids above): 4 PASSED
  - Cancelled bids cost nothing: 1 PASSED
  - Identical events for same seed (determinism): 2 PASSED
  - Ledger rows hidden until disclosure: 3 PASSED
  - Refunds at end of run: 2 PASSED
  - Track C cost model: 2 PASSED
  - Probability sources (raw, calibrated): 3 PASSED
  - Calibrated odds at prize 20 expect 0 bids: 1 PASSED
- **Result**: ✅ PASS — all 40 tests passed in 1.08s.

## P2/P3 Sweeps (runner.py)
- **Built**: Track A (2 odds sources × 5 prizes × 5 seeds = 50 runs) and
  Track C (4 prices × 3 prizes × 5 seeds = 60 runs). 8,545 events, 1,413 ledger rows.
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

## P4 Analysis (analysis.py, run.py)
- **Built**: Every number recomputed from the event log; H1/H2/H3 verdicts in
  `output/summary.json`.
- **Result**: ✅ PASS

## Fixes (2026-10-03)
- **Profit double-count**: profits were 100 credits too low (starting credits
  subtracted twice). Opening balances are now `account_funded` events at tick 0.
- **Nondeterminism**: runs varied with `PYTHONHASHSEED` (worlds iterated from a
  set). Now iterated in config order; cross-process determinism test added.
- **H1 verdict**: agents ranked by pass@1; each prize classified SUPPORTED /
  PARTIAL / NOT SUPPORTED. Weaker agents never bid at any prize (priced out by
  their prior), so "stop bidding" is not yet tested dynamically.
- **Checks**: 57 tests (42 engine, 15 analysis) — all PASSED.

## Stage 0 Cleanup (2026-10-03)
- `.gitignore` conflict markers resolved.
- Merged `data/success-table`: `data/success_table.csv` regenerates identically
  from `data/build_success_table.py`; each model's mean p matches its pass@1.
- README written; this log brought up to date.

## Stage 1: power odds (2026-10-03)
- **Built**: `success_table.csv` wired in as a third Track A odds source,
  `power` (p = score^γ, γ fit per model so mean p over 22 worlds = pass@1).
  `load_success_table()` maps its display names onto Table 1 names.
- **Why**: `calibrated` scales scores linearly, which caps strong worlds far
  too low (opus-4.7 gravity 0.41 vs 0.79) and props up weak ones.
- **Result**: under `power`, the hidden-structure worlds need the top prize
  (circle, extra_dimensions, dark_matter clear only at 200) and three_species
  is never solved. H1 SUPPORTED at prize 100 and 200.
- **Checks**: 3 new tests (known values, full coverage, order preserved);
  60 tests PASSED.

## Results app (2026-10-03)
- **Built**: `app.py` (local app: run simulation, run tests, view results) and
  `report.py` + `report_template.html` (same dashboard, exportable as
  `output/report.html`). Charts: clearing prize per world, agent balances
  payment by payment, mean profit per prize, public ledger, verdicts.
- **Checks**: `tests/test_report.py` checks dashboard balances and ledger
  counts against `summary.json`; 62 tests PASSED.

## Ledger leak fix (2026-10-03)
- **Fixed**: ledger rows stored each solver's hidden true pass probability in
  `outcome.metric`. Rows are public once disclosed, so that leaked the answer
  the market is meant to discover. `outcome` now holds only `passed`.
- **Checks**: `test_ledger_hides_true_probability`; 63 tests PASSED.

## Live bounties (2026-10-03)
- **Built**: `bounty.py` + a "Post a bounty" form in the app. A biology
  hypothesis, criterion and prize go to Claude, which returns a protocol priced
  from a fixed price list, a stated probability and a biosafety level. The bid
  rule (p × prize > cost, BSL-2 max) runs in code. No key → labelled example.
- **Checks**: `tests/test_bounty.py` (cost from price list, bid threshold,
  BSL block, clamping, example fallback, empty form); 69 tests PASSED.

## Open issues
- `config.yaml` is not read by the runner/analysis; values are hard-coded.
- H3 holds by construction: `llm_opus_unthrottled` reuses mda's pass rates.
- Disclosed ledger rows don't update other agents' beliefs (Stage 3).
